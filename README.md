# Graphist

Graphist is a logic programming language suitable for use as a pedagogical tool to teach programming.

The core vocabulary of the language is exceedingly small: just two words.  Learn to use these two words properly, and you have 
all the power of the Graphist programming language at your fingertips.

This simplicity is due to the American philosopher Charles Saunders Peirce, whose system of existential graphs is the basis of the Graphist language.

Graph

Graphist deals with graphs and nothing else.  Any input you supply to Graphist must be expressible as a graph in order for Graphist to understand it.  To tell Graphist that something is a graph, you use the graph function: (graph X), where X is the argument that you are defining to be a graph.  This is similar to declaring a variable in other languages.  

Cut

The cut function designates sommething as being absent from a graph - think of taking scizzors to paper to remove certain items
from the paper.  If the graph command has the affect of affirming its argument, a cut within a graph (which you can equate with 
the paper or computer screen you are drawing on) has the efect of negating its contents.  

Out of these basic principles we can define all of the logic functions that regularly make up the building blocks of programming languages.  To see how this is done, see one of the tutorials below.  If you are interested, experiment with the language, and if you have any good ideas, contribute to its development.
