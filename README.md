# Graphist

Graphist is a logic programming language simple enough to use as a pedagogical tool for teaching programming.

The core vocabulary of the language is exceedingly small: just two words.  Learn to use these two words properly, and you have 
all the power of the Graphist programming language at your fingertips.

This simplicity is due to the American philosopher Charles Saunders Peirce's system of existential graphs, which is an 
ingenious simplification of formal logic that Graphist is based on.

*The Two Words*

*Graph*

Graphist deals with graphs and nothing else.  Any input you supply to Graphist must be expressible as a graph in order for Graphist to understand it.  To tell Graphist that something is a graph, you use the graph function: (graph X), where X is the argument that you are defining to be a graph.  This is similar to declaring a variable in other languages.  

*Cut*

Cut designates sommething as absent from a graph - think of taking scizzors to paper to remove certain items
from the paper.  If the graph command has the affect of affirming its argument, a cut within a graph has the efect of negating its contents, since the argument is separated from what is true (on the graph).

Out of these basic principles we can define all logic functions that regularly form the building blocks of programming languages.  To see how this is done, see one of the tutorials below.  If you are interested, experiment with the language, and if you have any good ideas, contribute to its development.
